Today, the first public version of KorGE 0.5.2 has been published.

---

KorGE is a fairly new multiplatform 2D game engine written in Kotlin.

KorGE is part of a set of libraries called Korlibs that aim to provide simple, small, powerful, cohesive, enjoyable, portable, multiplatform and asynchronous functionality.

Since right now Kotlin only provides JVM target and an experimental JS target, KorGE is using JTransc to convert JVM bytecode into executables on several platforms.

Let's this journey begin!
