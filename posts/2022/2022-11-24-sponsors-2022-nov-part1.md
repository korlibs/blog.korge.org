Hey folks, a lot has been happening in KorGE this year, and in the past months. So let's recap and celebrate!

I'm going to do a small holiday break, but I'm also preparing a few videos explaining all the new stuff before I fully
go into the break. Here's the first two videos: 1. recapping & 2. kproject+memes. Hope you enjoy them!
