**What's happening with KorGE 14th Mar 2024:**

* Jobe, explained how to setup KorGE Fleks ECS in his stream in a twitch highlight: <https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2084989558?sr=a>
* Drestin created an awesome innovative game for the #7DRL Game JAM: Pictomancer. <https://drestin.itch.io/pictomancer-7drl-2024>, he also opensourced it: <https://gitlab.com/drestin-games/7drl-2024>
* We have finished splitting all the libraries into separate modules again.
* Also started experimenting with [Amper](https://github.com/JetBrains/amper/) to publish all the libraries that are not korge itself. The initial experiment is here: <https://github.com/korlibs/korge-korlibs>
