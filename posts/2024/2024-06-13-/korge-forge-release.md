We are thrilled to announce our new project: **KorGE Forge** IDE


KorGE Forge is an IDE based on IntelliJ and the KorGE IntellIJ IDEA Plugin.


This new IDE features functionality from the KorGE Plugin and a new Resource Explorer. We are also working in providing
an integrated editor and a live preview that will improve the workflow of developers and artists.


You can install it from: <https://forge.korge.org/>

The KorGE IntelliJ Plugin will continue to be published as before with a few constraints; please check the FAQ for
details. An update of the plugin `6.0.0` for IDEA `â‰¥ 2024.1` has also been submitted already and it is waiting for
approval.

KorGE Forge will provide a stable version of the IDE that is known to work with the KorGE Plugin, KorGE 6.0, Gradle and
the Gradle Android plugins.
