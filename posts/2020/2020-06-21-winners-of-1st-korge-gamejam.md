We are happy to announce the winners of the first KorGE gamejam.

# 1st (300 € & 1 year JetBrains All product license) - Parasite

For its overall completeness and a sense of classics. It reflected the jam theme very well and rounded it up with nice
effects, good controls and great sounds. The gameplay is the best overall.

# 2nd (150 €) - A classic snake game?

Actually being three games in one with three classic references. The visuals are great. The overall feel of the game is
very good and creates the motivation to finish it. The controls (especially in the mario land) sometimes feel a bit
unintuitive and the overall level of polishment is a bit behind the first place.

# 3rd (50 €) - Dungeon

The fog of war feature with raycasting and the classic Zelda/RPG feel make it a worthy third place. The replay
motivation is quite low after a few tries, which among other reasons prevented this game from placing better.

Although the game RoguyIsleMaze by Tobse did not tickle our classics nerves as much as the other submissions, we really
appreciate coding expertise the author put into it. Especially it being multiplayer, made us introduce a special prize
for this work. The author receives a 50 € Amazon gift card.
